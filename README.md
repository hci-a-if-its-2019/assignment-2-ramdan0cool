# Sketching and Prototyping
Using the information in the results of Assignment 1 for what is good and bad about the UI for designed tasks, we are going to make **Sketches** and **Prototypes**. These sketches and prototypes will lead to better design in Assignment 3. The prototypes will be then tested through a usability evaluation followed by design revision in Assignment 4.

## Part A: Sketches
Sketch at least **3 (three)** different UIs for the functions you are targeting. These three interfaces should be _dramatically different_ in terms of design directions. For example, they can be with different organizations of what functions on each screen or using a different layout of the icons, widgets, and menus on the screens. If you want, you can also incorporate non-on-screen UIs: physical buttons, gestures through motion sensors, etc.

You need **not** sketch the whole interface. It is not necessary for the sketches to have every function or every function in detail, but there should be enough to show off your general idea. **Be creative!** Draw your idea and label a few of the widgets so we can tell your intent. The goal is to have at least 3 good UIs in *interesting* ways. Sketches should be done on paper with pens and/or pencils (do not use a computer).

### 2. Version Differences

Original
There are some redundant buttons and search bar positioned too far to the right.

Sketch 1
Remove redundant elements and reposition search bar for easier spotting.

Sketch 2
(For Mobile browser) Reorder the elements and collapse the 'More' element for cleaner UI.

Sketch 3
Like Sketch 1, but with Mobile browser layout

### 3. Selected Sketch

Sketch 1, because there are not many elements need to be changed, and makes the UI more cleaner and easily recognizable. It also reduced the amount of time needed to read a story, specific or random.

### 4. Design Rationale

During the inquiry process, I feel that whenever I want to search a story, I have to search the search bar first.```Puns!```
It seems that the search bar is on the more 'empty' part of the site, more spesifically the right side. This means it is easy to lose sight or forgot where the search bar is, because many site (if not all) positioned their search bar near the more focal part of the site.

## Part B: Assumptions
### 1. Hardware

(Mobile) Screen resolution: 720x1280

Screen type: RGB (Optimal)

(Desktop) Input device: Mouse, keyboard
(Android) Input device: touchscreen


### 2. Users
